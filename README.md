# Procedural_generation_2D

Just a 2D procedural map generator made in Python3 for fun.

## WHAT IT DOES:

For now it only creates a .ppm picture of a map with procedural generation using Perlin noise. Maybe it will be able to create a png picture later.

## HOW TO USE IT ?

1. Run procedural_generation_2D.py with Python3
2. Enter the width then the height of the map you want, in pixels
3. Choose the mode you want to use
4. Wait during processing
5. Open Generated_map.ppm with your image manager (if it doesn't work then use your Office editor to open it)
6. Enjoy :)

## LANGUAGE:

-   User interface and code are in english.
-   Comments are only in french for the time being (maybe an english version will comes later).
