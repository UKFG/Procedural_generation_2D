# Procedural_generation_2D
Just a 2D procedural generation made in Python3 for fun.


## WHAT IT DOES:
For now it only creates a .ppm picture of a map with procedural generation using Perlin noise. Maybe it will be able to create a png picture later.


## HOW TO USE IT ?
1. Run procedural_generation_2D.py with Python3
2. Enter the lenght then the height of the map you want, in pixels
3. Choose the mode you want to use
3. Wait during processing
4. Open Generated_map.ppm with your image manager (if it doesn't work then use your Office text editor to open it)
5. Enjoy :)


## LANGUAGE:
- User Interface is in english.
- Comments are only in french for the time being (maybe an english version will comes later).


## NAMING STYLE:
I didn't use the real Python's naming conventions in this project because I think some of them aren't compatible with my way of naming, so this is a little alias to clearly understand them if you didn't:

* v_  : variable
* fi_ : file
* cl_ : class
* f_  : function
* m_  : method
* p_  : package
