# Procedural_generation_2D
Just a 2D procedural generation made in Python3 for fun. /!\ WIP  /!\

######### WHAT IT DOES ##########  
For now it only creates a .ppm picture of a map with procedural generation using Perlin noise

########### LANGUAGE ############  
Only in french for the time being (maybe an english version will comes when it will be fully functional)
